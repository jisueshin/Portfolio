    "detailDesc": ["Recently, notable uses of AI-generated images in political campaigns have raised questions regarding the ethicality and implications of such practices in politics. Moreover, whether AI-generated images are effective in persuading the electorate is a question that remains unanswered. In this study, we surveyed 36 participants to ascertain: 1) the ability to distinguish between AI and human art, 2) the efficacy of AI-generated images in political campaigns, and 3) public attitudes towards their usage.",
    "As a political science major, I led research into the historical applications and evolution of political art in various campaigns. Leveraging insights gleaned from this research, I curated a collection of pertinent examples to construct the survey, aimed at gauging perceptions and attitudes towards political imagery. My teammates then curated AI-generated versions of the images to gauge participantsâ€™ ability to distinguish the human art from the AI counterpart and their perception of AI art. From there, we analyzed the qualitative and quantitative data we had gathered from the surveys to generate insights regarding our research objectives.",
    "Our findings revealed that participants could typically distinguish AI-generated art from human-made art approximately 70% of the time, though this varied significantly across specific cases. Furthermore, both AI and human-generated art were perceived to be equally effective in political campaigns; however, AI-generated images were consistently rated as less visually appealing when recognized as such. Interestingly, respondents demonstrated a neutral stance towards the use of AI images in politics, yet raised concerns regarding copyright infringement and the necessity for legal safeguards."
